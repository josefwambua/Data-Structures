Data Structures
Introduction
This repository serves as a reference for implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms in various programming languages (such as JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.). It is designed to help students, developers, and enthusiasts explore how data structures work, their use cases, and how different algorithms operate on these structures.

Core Data Structures Implemented:
Arrays
Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
Stacks
Queues
Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)
Hash Tables (Hash Maps)
Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
Tries
Core Algorithms Implemented:
Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Fibonacci, etc.)
Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Greedy Algorithms
Backtracking Algorithms (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, etc.)
Data Structures

This section contains the implementation of commonly used data structures. Each data structure has its own directory, with the code and examples in the respective language.

Examples:
Linked Lists: Learn how to create and manipulate linked lists, including operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Stacks and Queues: Learn about LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) principles.
Binary Search Trees (BST): Explore BST operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and tree traversal.
Graphs: Implement different representations of graphs (adjacency list, adjacency matrix), and perform graph traversal using DFS and BFS.
Algorithms
This section includes common algorithms, divided by category. The goal is to help you understand how each algorithm works and its time complexity.

Examples:
Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
Search Algorithms: Linear and Binary Search algorithms.
Dynamic Programming: Solve optimization problems like the Fibonacci sequence, the Knapsack problem, etc.
Graph Algorithms: Implementations of DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path, and more.
Greedy Algorithms: Examples like the Fractional Knapsack problem and activity selection problem.
